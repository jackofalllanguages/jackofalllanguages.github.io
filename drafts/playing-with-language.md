# How to play with language

in this post i want to talk about using chunks or model sentences or phrases as a way to learn grammar. we are going to focus on how we can internalize a sentence and its grammar amd then learn the relationships between the elements of that sentence and other sentences amd words. About how we can learn and practice by playing with modal sentences and using them to make new sentences.
