My name is Fletcher Hardison. I’m a linguist and English teacher. A father of two girls and a husband. I’m passionate about learning languages and helping others do it too. I’m convinced that most people have troubling learning languages because no one ever taught them how. I have an M.A. in Linguistics and have been teaching English overseas for ~3 years at the university level. I study languages when I’m not teaching, doing research, or spending time with my family.
